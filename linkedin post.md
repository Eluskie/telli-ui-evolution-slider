Design case studies where you can actually *use* the components?!? NO WAY

Last year I had the utmost pleasure to work for a bit at telli and I want to tell you about it. 
I just shipped an interactive case study where every component is clickable and live. No Figma embeds. No static screenshots.

Real deployed components you can interact with: [link]

What's inside:
→ Before/after slider showing the agent redesign
→ Live custom loading animation
→ The new look of the chat experience
→ The actual tab system that reduced customer anxiety
→ Interactive components I shipped via PR

The challenge? Build design foundations without becoming the bottleneck. Establish a system while engineers ship features weekly.

Results:
- 50 screens migrated to the new system
- 9h average time to feature
- Design system that kept paying off with every new feature
- Code contributions (including the CSV import I designed and built)

"Gerard brought incredible energy and momentum to telli. He's the kind of person who dives in, moves fast, and makes things happen." → yup, that's me 


Sometimes the best way to show the work is to let people actually experience it. Designer, don't be afraid to build with AI the pieces of work you've done to show better what you are capable of, if you have any questions or I can help you with anything let me know!

Thanks a lot for the trust Seb, Finn and all telli's team you are off to create something big
